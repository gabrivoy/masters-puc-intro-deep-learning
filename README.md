# Introduction to Deep Learning

This repository houses all material related to my master's course on Deep Learning. The course was done in the first semester of 2025 at Pontifícia Universidade Católica do Rio de Janeiro (PUC-Rio).

## Assignments

The course consists of 4 assignments, that build up to a "mini-article"/"mini-thesis" at the end. The assignments are as follows:

### Literature Review

A review of the state-of-the-art in a specific area of deep learning. The review should answer the following questions:

- Which problem do you intend to solve?
- What are the existing solutions to that problem?
- How do you intend to solve that problem?
- What is new in your approach? What is different from the literature?
- What are the expected benefits from your approach?

This part of the work is due 07-apr-2025, and I'll be working on "Super Resolution" algorithms with a focus on video game images upscaling.

The work can be found in the `literature_review` folder: [Super Resolution in Video Games - A Literature Review](literature_review/literature_review.md).

### Practical Implementation

The work can be found in the `implementation` folder: [Implementation Results](implementation/implementation_results.md).

### Final Presentation

Can be found in the `presentation` folder: [Final Presentation](presentation/slides.pdf).

### Paper Ready for Submission

Due 07-jul-2025.
