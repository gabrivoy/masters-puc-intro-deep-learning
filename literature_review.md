## Opening remarks

I don't remember exactly when I got my first video game console, but I do remember that was a Master System console with the Sonic the Hedgehog game. I was never able to finish the game on my own, but I remember that I used to play it a lot with my parents. Since then, I've never skipped a generation of consoles, being amazed by how the gaming industry evolved over the years, creating incredible experiences and stories. Eventually I grew up a nerd and now work in AI, and still love video games. This work is a way to combine those passions, and a way to learn more about the current state of the art in super resolution techniques, which is a topic that I find fascinating. I hope you enjoy reading this literature review as much as I enjoyed writing it.

## 1. Introduction & Problem Statement

> "Itâ€™s dangerous to go alone, take this!" - Old Man from *The Legend of Zelda*

Video games are an integral part of modern entertainment and culture nowadays, with a market size of over $274 billion dollars calculated in 2024[1]. With the rapid advancement of technology, the demand for high-quality graphics and immersive experiences in newer video games has increased significantly. To meet this demand, game developers are constantly pushing the boundaries of graphics and visual fidelity in actual hardware. High-resolution textures and assets are essential for creating realistic environments and characters that enhance the overall gaming experience. As a result, the video game industry is witnessing a growing trend towards higher resolutions, with many games now supporting 2K, 4K and even 8K resolutions[2].

However, the development of high-resolution textures and assets can be time-consuming and resource-intensive. Graphic processing units (GPUs) and other hardware components must be capable of rendering these high-resolution assets in real-time, multiple frames per second (FPS). This can be a significant challenge, especially while textures and assets are evolving in a faster pace than hardware capabilities[3].

### 1.1. Super Resolution

This is where super resolution techniques come into play, particularly those leveraging deep learning methods. Super resolution[4] refers to the process of enhancing the resolution of images or videos, allowing for the generation of high-quality visuals from lower-resolution sources. Using those techniques, graphic assets can be rendered at lower resolutions and then upscaled to higher resolutions without losing significant detail or quality. This is particularly useful in the gaming industry, where real-time rendering is crucial for maintaining a smooth and immersive experience.

Two major players on the graphics market, NVIDIA and AMD, have already implemented super resolution techniques in their graphics cards. NVIDIA's Deep Learning Super Sampling (DLSS)[5] and AMD's FidelityFX Super Resolution (FSR)[6] are examples of how these companies are leveraging deep learning to enhance the gaming experience. DLSS technologies are locked behind their respective hardware, which means that they are not available for all users, while FidelityFX is open to other vendors and even has its own SDK. This has led to a growing interest in exploring and developing super resolution techniques that can be applied to video games, particularly those that are not limited to specific hardware.

### 1.2 Goal of the project

The goal of this project will be to explore the current state of super resolution techniques in the video game industry, focusing on deep learning methods. Even with all of the advancements in the area, we do not have many public available datasets focused on Super Resolution for gaming content. To study this, we will leverage the Super Resolution Gaming Dataset, that was created by Evgenii Pishchik and is available on both GitHub[7] and Kaggle[8] platforms since last year. The dataset consists of multiple images in different resolutions generated by the Unreal Engine game engine. Some algorithms are already implemented in the dataset, so we will explore the performance of other algorithms, both more modern and older, and compare them with the existing ones.

A handful of methods have been proposed along the years to address super resolution problems. Going over the literature, it is possible to find the following main categories of algorithms: classic interpolation methods, convolutional neural networks (CNNs), generative adversarial networks (GANs), and more recent approaches using transformers and diffusion models. Each of these categories has its own strengths and weaknesses, and the choice of algorithm depends on the specific requirements of the application. While the first category is more traditional and based on simpler mathematical models, the latter categories leverage deep learning techniques to achieve better results. The following sections will provide an overview of the machine learning based categories and their respective algorithms, with table 1 summarizing the main features of each algorithm and its performance metrics on the SRGD dataset.

### 2.2. Metrics overview

It is important to understand the metrics presented in the table. The most common metrics used to evaluate super resolution algorithms are Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR), Structural Similarity Index (SSIM), and Learned Perceptual Image Patch Similarity (LPIPS).

#### 2.2.1. Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR)

PSNR measures the ratio between the maximum possible power of a signal and the power of corrupting noise and is calculated by[]:

$$
PSNR = 10 \cdot \log_{10} \left( \frac{MAX^2}{MSE} \right)
$$

Where:

- \(MAX\) is the maximum possible pixel value of the image (255 for 8-bit images).
- \(MSE\) is the mean squared error between the original and the super-resolved image.
- A higher PSNR value indicates better image quality.

#### 2.2.2. Structural Similarity Index (SSIM)

SSIM assesses the similarity between two images based on luminance, contrast, and structure. It is calculated using the following formula[]:

$$
SSIM = \frac{(2\mu_x\mu_y + C_1)(2\sigma_{xy} + C_2)}{(\mu_x^2 + \mu_y^2 + C_1)(\sigma_x^2 + \sigma_y^2 + C_2)}
$$

Where:

- $\mu_x$ and $\mu_y$ are the average luminance of the original and super-resolved images, respectively.
- $\sigma_x^2$ and $\sigma_y^2$ are the variances of the original and super-resolved images, respectively.
- $\sigma_{xy}$ is the covariance between the original and super-resolved images.
- $C_1$ and $C_2$ are small constants to stabilize the division.
- SSIM values range from -1 to 1, with 1 indicating perfect similarity.

#### 2.2.3. Learned Perceptual Image Patch Similarity (LPIPS)

LPIPS is a perceptual metric that evaluates the similarity between two images based on deep features extracted from a pre-trained neural network. It is calculated using a model that is trained on a labeled dataset of human-judged perceptual similarity[]. A higher LPIPS score indicates lower perceptual similarity, while a lower score indicates higher perceptual similarity. The LPIPS metric is particularly useful for evaluating the quality of super-resolved images, as it aligns more closely with human perception compared to traditional metrics like PSNR and SSIM.

## 3. Proposed Solution

> "It's super effective!" - *PokÃ©mon*

Recently, a technique called Hybrid Attention Transformer (HAT) was proposed on a paper called "Activating More Pixels in Image Super-Resolution Transformer", in 2023[]. This model is being widely tested for super resolution cases in image restoration[]. The idea is to bring the power of the HAT algorithm to benchmark it against the existing algorithms in the Super Resolution Gaming Dataset.

### Hybrid Attention Transformer (HAT)

## 4. Expected Benefits

> "Praise the Sun!" - Solaire of Astora from *Dark Souls*

The expected benefits of this project include evaluating a new algorithm against the existing ones in the SRGD, trying to outperform them and add a new benchmark option to the dataset. This will be a new approach for the HAT algorithm, as it has not been tested on video game content before, being benchmarked in datasets like DIV2K and Urban100.

Additionally, the project will provide a comprehensive overview of the SRGD, that is a large dataset with more than 50GBs of data, using EDA techniques to analyze the data and understand its structure. This will help us to understand the strengths and weaknesses of the dataset, paving the way for future research and development in the field of super resolution techniques for video games with the SRGD. Findings will be shared openly on GitHub, contributing to the open-source community and potentially improving existing algorithms or developing new ones.

Finally, if time allows, we will also explore more basic algorithms, such as SRCNN, to understand the differences between them and the more complex ones. This will help us to understand the evolution of super resolution techniques and their impact on the gaming industry, while also paving the way for enthusiasts (since it is a simpler model to execute) to explore the topic further and benchmark the other algorithms in the dataset.
