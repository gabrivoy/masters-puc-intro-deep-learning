## 1. Introduction & Problem Statement

> "It’s dangerous to go alone, take this!" - Old Man from *The Legend of Zelda*

Video games are an integral part of modern entertainment and culture nowadays, with a market size of over $274 billion dollars calculated in 2024[1]. With the rapid advancement of technology, the demand for high-quality graphics and immersive experiences in newer video games has increased significantly. To meet this demand, game developers are constantly pushing the boundaries of graphics and visual fidelity in actual hardware. High-resolution textures and assets are essential for creating realistic environments and characters that enhance the overall gaming experience. As a result, the video game industry is witnessing a growing trend towards higher resolutions, with many games now supporting 2K, 4K and even 8K resolutions[2].

However, the development of high-resolution textures and assets can be time-consuming and resource-intensive. Graphic processing units (GPUs) and other hardware components must be capable of rendering these high-resolution assets in real-time, multiple frames per second (FPS). This can be a significant challenge, especially while textures and assets are evolving in a faster pace than hardware capabilities[3].

### 1.1. Super Resolution

This is where super resolution techniques come into play, particularly those leveraging deep learning methods. Super resolution[4] refers to the process of enhancing the resolution of images or videos, allowing for the generation of high-quality visuals from lower-resolution sources. Using those techniques, graphic assets can be rendered at lower resolutions and then upscaled to higher resolutions without losing significant detail or quality. This is particularly useful in the gaming industry, where real-time rendering is crucial for maintaining a smooth and immersive experience.

Two major players on the graphics market, NVIDIA and AMD, have already implemented super resolution techniques in their graphics cards. NVIDIA's Deep Learning Super Sampling (DLSS)[5] and AMD's FidelityFX Super Resolution (FSR)[6] are examples of how these companies are leveraging deep learning to enhance the gaming experience. DLSS technologies are locked behind their respective hardware, which means that they are not available for all users, while FidelityFX is open to other vendors and even has its own SDK. This has led to a growing interest in exploring and developing super resolution techniques that can be applied to video games, particularly those that are not limited to specific hardware.

### 1.2 Goal of the project

The goal of this project will be to explore the current state of super resolution techniques in the video game industry, focusing on deep learning methods. Even with all of the advancements in the area, we do not have many public available datasets focused on Super Resolution for gaming content. To study this, we will leverage the Super Resolution Gaming Dataset, that was created by Evgenii Pishchik and is available on both GitHub[7] and Kaggle[8] platforms since last year. The dataset consists of multiple images in different resolutions generated by the Unreal Engine game engine. Some algorithms are already implemented in the dataset, so we will explore the performance of other algorithms and compare them with the existing ones.
