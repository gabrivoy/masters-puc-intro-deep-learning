# What is Super Resolution? ü§î

Super Resolution (SR) enhances image or video resolution, making visuals clearer and more detailed.

- Uses algorithms to generate high-res images from low-res inputs.
- Key uses:
  - **Medical Imaging**: Better diagnostic images.
  - **Satellite Imagery**: Sharper analysis.
  - **Video Games**: Upscaled graphics without extra asset costs.

---

# Why Does SR Matter in Games? üéÆ

Modern games demand high-quality visuals, but high-res assets are costly and resource-intensive.

- SR enables real-time upscaling from lower resolutions, saving resources while maintaining visual quality.
- Benefits:
  - **Performance**: Less hardware strain.
  - **Accessibility**: Playable on lower-end devices.
  - **Cost Efficiency**: Fewer high-res assets needed.

# DLSS and FidelityFX üîç

DLSS (Deep Learning Super Sampling) and FidelityFX are leading SR technologies in gaming.

- **DLSS**: Developed by NVIDIA, uses AI to upscale images in real-time, enhancing performance without sacrificing quality.
- **FidelityFX**: AMD's solution, focuses on high-quality upscaling and image enhancement, compatible with a wide range of hardware.
- Both technologies leverage deep learning to improve image quality and performance in games.

---

# Open Source Alternatives üîì

While DLSS is locked to NVIDIA hardware, more accessible alternatives are emerging. FidelityFX is open source and has a development SDK available.

- Also, there's room for new open-source solutions in the SR space, especially for video games.
- Open source SR solutions can democratize access to high-quality upscaling, allowing developers to implement advanced techniques without proprietary constraints.

---

# Proposed Approach üõ†Ô∏è

- Use the SRGD as a benchmark for training and testing.
- Implement and evaluate the performance of two models not previously applied to SRGD:
  - **SRCNN** (Super-Resolution Convolutional Neural Network)
  - **HAT** (High-Performance Attention Transformer)

# SRCNN üß†

> SRCNN is one of the first deep learning models for SR, using a simple CNN architecture to reconstruct high-res images from interpolated low-res inputs.

# HAT üß†

> HAT uses a hybrid attention transformer architecture, enabling superior perceptual reconstruction at higher computational cost.

# Experiments and Results üö®

For evaluating the performance of the models, we used the following metrics:

- **PSNR (Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio)**: Measures the quality of the reconstructed image compared to the original.
- **SSIM (Structural Similarity Index)**: Assesses the structural similarity between the original and reconstructed images.
- **LPIPS (Learned Perceptual Image Patch Similarity)**: Evaluates perceptual similarity, focusing on how humans perceive differences in images.

# Conclusions and Future Work üìù

<small>

- We got a better PSNR on SRCNN models and a better LPIPS on the HAT model, but we still need to improve the SSIM metric.
- Overall, the HAT model shows superior performance in perceptual quality and structural integrity compared to SRCNN.
- We added new information to the SRGD, with the SRCNN (+ Sharpen) and HAT models, which can be used in future works.
- Training more time/epochs with more data and different hyperparameters could improve the results even further.
- Engineering was a bottleneck in this work, since computer vision requires intense CPU/GPU and RAM usage, and datasets are large (50GB+).
- Inference times could be measured, but we couldn't do that in this work.
